Hi there.

This is an e-mail message. Maybe you already guessed that.

You still owe us lots of money for this stuff:

<% @invoice.invoice_lines.each do |il| %>
<%= "#{il.quantity.to_s}x #{il.text}. #{pretty_price(il.taxed_price)}" %>
<% end %>

Total: <%= pretty_price(@invoice.taxed_price) %>

Come on. You know you'd love to pay. Here's a link for payment details:

<%= url_for :controller => 'invoices', :action => 'uuid', :uuid => @invoice.uuid %>
