Hi there.

This is an e-mail message. Maybe you already guessed that.

Here's some random computer parts for you to enjoy:

<% @order.order_lines.each do |ol| %>
<%= "#{ol.quantity.to_s}x #{ol.product.name}. #{pretty_price(ol.product.taxed_price.rounded)}" %>
<% end %>

Great, isn't it? We knew you'd love that.
