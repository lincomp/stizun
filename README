General information
===================

Stizun is a deliberately simplistic e-commerce solution written
in Ruby on Rails.

Main features:

 * Unique shipping calculation system for stores that don't have
   their own warehouses but ship directly from suppliers to their
   customers (just-in-time). Can also calculate shipping for a mix
   of various suppliers in one order.
 * Importers for product catalog CSV files of large European distributors 
   (Ingram Micro, Alltron). Can be extended with your own CSV importers.
 * UUID-based invoice generator: Users don't need to remember their
   login details just to follow a link from an e-mail to their
   invoice.

It's not quite ready for production yet, but we're getting there!
