General information
===================

This is what powers Lincomp, my online store. The system focuses on
a lot of automation in the backend, e.g. automatically retrieving new
prices and products from CSV files, automatically switching to the
chepest one offered by any supplier, etc.

It's probably useless for you, but we've put the source out there
anyhow.


Requirements
============

 * Ruby 1.9.3 (can't guarantee anything for jRuby or Ruby 1.9.2)
 * Debian GNU/Linux (not tested on anything else)
 * MySQL (because of Sphinx)
 * Sphinx (for fulltext search)


Installation
============

The installation is quite typical for a Rails project, but here it is
step by step:

 * Grab source code
 * Go to the directory you have the source in
 * `bundle install`
 * Edit config/database.yml to suit your database config
 * Edit config/stizun.yml to your liking
 * `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
 * Edit db/seeds.rb to your liking (change the values to something reasonable)
 * `bundle exec rake db:seed`
 * `bundle exec rake ts:conf ts:reindex ts:start`
 * `bundle exec rails s`
 * Go to http://localhost:3000
 * Register a new user
 * `bundle exec rails c`
 * `u = User.first`
 * `u.groups << Usergroup.where(:name => 'Admin').first`
 * `u.save`

Repeat this in your production environment (`RAILS_ENV=production`) when you're
ready to go into production mode.
